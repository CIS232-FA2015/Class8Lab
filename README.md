# RandomStudentPicker


# Class 8 Lab
Modify this program in the following way:

1. Add (optional) third column to students.csv
	1. The column can contain N for "not here" or Y for "here".
	2. If the column does not exist, or is empty, assume "here".
2. Modify the program to only call on students that are here.
3. The leaderboard should still show every student.
